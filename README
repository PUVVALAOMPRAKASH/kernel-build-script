Kernel Build Automation Script

A Bash-based automation project to compile and package Android/Linux kernels using Clang/LLVM or GCC.
It automates cloning, configuration, compilation, and zip packaging via AnyKernel3, reducing manual build steps.

🧩 Features

One-command kernel build (via clone.sh and run.sh)

Supports both Clang and GCC toolchains

Auto packaging using AnyKernel3

Build logs and optional zip signing

⚠️ Current Status

Tested under WSL Ubuntu — full Clang builds fail due to linker incompatibility (libc.so.6 issue).
A GCC version was added for partial builds and validation of the pipeline.
Works fully on native Linux or VM setups.

💡 Key Learning

Gained hands-on experience with kernel configuration, cross-compilers, build automation, and debugging environment-toolchain mismatches.
